### Identify and understand all the threats you face.

A threat is someone or something that can inflict harm, loss, damage, or punishment.  

Threats may manifest as assault, torture, sexual violence, imprisonment, or even assassination. 

You may not be able to control threats, but you can manage them by increasing your security. 

## List your threats

First, draw on your context and stakeholder analysis to identify as many possible threats as you can. This process is part of a threat analysis. 

## Remember direct, indirect, and possible threats

* Direct threats are targeted.

*For example, criminals may abduct someone because they believe the organisation they work for will pay a ransom.* 

* Indirect threats could still affect you and your team.

*For example, assets may be stolen by random criminals active in a certain part of town.* 

* Monitor for possible threats. 

Which signs and events could indicate threats are increasing? Which could lead to a new threat? 

*For example, an attack on someone you know may be a sign that a threat is intesifying, or political instability may lead to street violence.*

## Analyse your threats

For each threat, ask yourself: 

- What kind of threat is it? 
- Who are the possible targets? 
- Is it limited to a certain area, time, or activity? 
- Is it frequent, isolated, recurring, or ongoing?
- Has the nature of the threat changed recently, or might it change soon? How will you know?  
- What else do you know about the threat? What else do you need to know?
