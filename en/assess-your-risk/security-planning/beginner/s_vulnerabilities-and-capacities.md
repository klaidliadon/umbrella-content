title: Vulnerabilities and Capacities
---
### List vulnerabilities that make the threats you face more likely to happen to you, and your capacities to prevent threats or respond to them. 

## Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability is any factor which increases the likelihood of harm or loss. 

*For example, if kidnapping is a threat, going to a meeting in an isolated area makes you more vulnerable.* 

Vulnerabilities may be due to circumstances you can change. Changes that reduce your vulnerabilities can reduce your exposure to threats, or their impact. 

*For example, you can choose to move a meeting to a heavily populated area near a police station to reduce your vulnerability to kidnap.* 

In other cases, your personal attributes may make you vulnerable. For example, women and LGBTQI persons face additional threats in most societies. 

Even if you cannot reduce your vulnerability, you can still increase your capacity to protect yourself and respond to threats. 

## Capacities

Capacities are any resources which improve your security, like knowledge, abilities, clothing or equipment, tools and contacts.
