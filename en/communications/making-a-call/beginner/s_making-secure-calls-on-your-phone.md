# Signal

Signal is a free, simple, open-source tool that protects voice calls with end-to-end encryption. 

Download Signal for: 

*	[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms); 
*	[iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669);

The person you are communicating with must also install Signal.

## Your phone number is your Signal username. 

*	There is no separate username or password to manage or lose. 
*	This makes it easier for you; it could also make it easier to analyze the traffic it produces and trace it back to you. 
*	Your mobile number may identify you and undermine anonymous communication. 

## Signal uses a central server. 

*	Signal developers [Open Whisper Systems](https://signal.org/about/) operate a central server. You can't run your own, which would give you more control over your security. 
*	However, they cannot hear your conversations, so no one else can either. 

(Learn more about this in Signal for [Android](umbrella://tools/messaging/s_signal-for-android.md) and [iOS](umbrella://tools/messaging/s_signal-for-ios.md).)

*Some countries block Signal servers to prevent secure communications. To circumvent blocking, use a VPN.*
