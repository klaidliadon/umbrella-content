# Protect personal information

Mobile phones may store all sorts of data: 

*	Call history;
*	Messages and email; 
*	Contacts;
*	Location data;
*	Photos and video;
*	Browsing history;
*	Passwords;
*	Social media activity;
*	Files. 

Take these steps to minimize the risk of exposing personal information about you and your colleagues.

## Encrypt your device.

If the device allows encryption under settings, apply it.

(Learn [basic security for Android](umbrella://tools/other/s_android.md) and how to [encrypt your iPhone](umbrella://tools/encryption/s_encrypt-your-iphone.md).)

## Move data.

Move confidential files and photos from your phone to a secure location as soon as possible.

(Learn about [protecting files](umbrella://information/protecting-files) and [backing up](umbrella://information/backing-up).) 

## Erase data.

Erase sensitive information regularly, including call records, messages, contacts, or photos.

(Learn more about [safely deleting](umbrella://information/safely-deleting).)

## Protect your device

*	Log out of active apps and accounts. 
*	Only use trusted phone dealers and repair shops.
*	Delete all information before selling, handing on or disposing of your phone. 

## Protect your SIM

Keep SIM cards and memory cards you use in your phone secure:

*	Don't leave them at the repair shop when your phone is being serviced. 
*	Physically destroy SIM cards or memory cards. Never sell or hand them on. 

## Use ObscuraCam

ObscuraCam is a free, open-source app by the [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/). Use it to protect privacy when capturing pictures or video. 

> *For example, if you take photos or record video of a sensitive event, it might be dangerous to you or to those who appear in the recordings if your phone fell into the wrong hands.* 

ObscuraCam can:

*	Blur faces in photos;
*	Delete the original photos;
*	Upload media to your server if you set one up.

(Learn how to use [ObscuraCam](umbrella://tools/messaging/s_obscuracam.md).)  

## Use CameraV

Photos and videos you take on your phone include metadata. Metadata can reveal the identity and location of your device. 

Metadata supports the credibility of images and video used as evidence. But metadata can also put you or others at risk. 

[CameraV](https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav/) is a plugin for ObscuraCam. 

CameraV can: 

*	Store media with valuable metadata securely; 
*	Strip metadata from images and video to share on social media.

## Use eyeWitness to Atrocities 

eyeWitness is a free Android app that you can use to capture sensitive photo and video that may be used in trials.

eyeWitness can:

*	Store images and metadata captured using the app safely on your device;
*	Upload images to a secure server for legal analysis;
*	Store offline copies of images that may be used as evidence and document who has access. 

[eyeWitness to Atrocities](http://www.eyewitnessproject.org/) is available from Google Play, or request a direct download from [general@eyewitnessproject.org](general@eyewitnessproject.org).
