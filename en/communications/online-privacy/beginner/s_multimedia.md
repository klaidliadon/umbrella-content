Social media can help expose wrongdoing, but can also expose vulnerable people to threats. 

Sharing images or recordings of other people may compromise their privacy. 

Use your judgement before you publish or repost multimedia content, and encourage your contacts to do the same. 

# Issues to consider

## Consent

*	Seek informed consent before you post videos, photos, or audio clips of someone else. 

Informed means they understand the purpose, potential audience, and potential risks of your post. 

*Note: vulnerable people may not be able to give informed consent, including children.* 

*	As a rule of thumb, don't share anything about people you know unless they ask you to or have already shared it themselves.

## Live or public recordings

*	Know your rights. What you are legally allowed to film, for example, depends on where you are. 

*	Is it safe to broadcast? Don't put yourself or others at risk. 

*	Are people aware they are being recorded? Respect anyone who moves away or opts out. 

*	Could your broadcast cause unintended harm?

## Content shared by someone else 

*	Don't spread unverified content.

Images and recordings may be fake or deliberately misleading. 

*	Don't assume the subjects have consented or evaluated their own security.  

*	Copy original content and note where it came from in case it is removed.

## Metadata

Many cameras embed hidden data (metadata tags) that reveal information about the device and the date, time and location it was used. 

Social media sites may publish this information when you upload content.

Metadata supports the credibility of images and video used as evidence. But metadata can also put you or others at risk.
