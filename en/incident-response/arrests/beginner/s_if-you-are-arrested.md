title: If you are Arrested
---
## Tell your team

Your first goal is to get outside support.

* Contact your team or someone else who can help to get you released. 

*	Ask to see an independent lawyer, interpreter, embassy official, or medical professional as needed. 

*	Be persistent. 

*   Identify who you work for if appropriate.

*   Verify lawyers were sent by your allies, not the local authorities, before telling them something important or acting on their advice. 

*In some countries, lawyers appointed for you may share confidential information with the authorities or encourage you to confess on their behalf.*

## Take mental notes

Help your team understand the situation. 

*   Who arrested you? 

*   How did they identify themselves, and what agency are they with? 
What is their attitude? 

*   Where are they taking you?

*   Who else was arrested?

*   Why were you arrested? What is their agenda?

*   How much do they know about you and your work?

*   How long can they keep you?

## Don't volunteer information

*	Be calm, helpful, and cooperative, but don't volunteer information. 

## Don't confess

*   Hostile authorities may seek to obtain a confession to support false allegations.

*   Avoid signing anything you don't agree with or written in a language you don't understand.

## Mentally prepare

* Stay calm; 

*	Prepare for a long wait in case you are held for a long time;

* Calmly request anything you are entitled to (e.g. a phone call, a lawyer, or a toilet visit);

* You may be searched or subject to a medical exam; 

*	You may be threatened, assaulted, cuffed, confined, or deprived of sleep, food, or water. 

_You should have regular access to water, especially women who are menstruating, going through menopause, or pregnant. Women should also have ready access to free sanitary towels or pads. Raise abuse or issues with your treatment immediately with the authorities who made the arrest, your team, and your legal support._
