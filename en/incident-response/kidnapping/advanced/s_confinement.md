## Mentally prepare

* Anticipate periods of isolation and intimidation;
*	Prepare for a long wait;
*	Do not believe everything you are told. 

*If you face assault or sexual violence, your objective should be to survive, and minimize your physical and psychological harm.*

(Learn about [Discrimination and Torture](umbrella://incident-response/arrests/beginner/s_discrimination-and-torture.md).)

## Be respectful 

*   Try to build a relationship with kidnappers;
*	Try to persuade them to contact your colleagues or the authorities. Find reasons why this would benefit them.
*	Keep to subjects of mutual interest, such as family and children; 
*	Encourage kidnappers to view you as a person;
*	Do not discuss politics or religion.

*Developing a relationship with guards may reduce your risk of assault.*

## Keep your dignity

*	Cooperate without being servile or aggressive; 
*	Do not beg or plead. 

## Retain your identity

*   Try to retain personal belongings such as clothes, ID, watch, or books; 
*	Ask for practical items such as toiletries, medicines, or time to exercise.

_Avoid exchanging clothes with kidnappers which may make it harder for rescuers to identify you._

## Do not threaten

*   Be aware of body language and non-verbal communication; 
*	Do not threaten to testify or retaliate; 
*	Do not indicate that you recognise kidnappers who are concealing their identity.

## Take mental notes 

Look for information that may help establish communication, monitor potential risk, and help the authorities after your release.

*   Note kidnapper mannerisms, behaviour, speech, clothes, rank, etc;
*	Try to understand their attitude and intentions.

**Keep a low profile. Do not appear to study your abductors.** 

## Look after yourself

*   Eat and drink water, even if you have no appetite or food is unpalatable; 
*	Maintain a routine of rest and activity; 
*	Try to exercise daily;
*	Try to keep track of time; 
*	Maintain personal hygiene;
*	Maintain your values.

## Think positive

*   Remember pleasant memories;
*	Find ways to connect to your personality; 
*	Practise meditation;
*	Mentally reconstruct books or movies; 
*	Do not despair or fear you are abandoned;
*	Remember your colleagues and family are working for your release.

## Cooperate

*   Agree to talk on the radio, phone or video;
*	Say only what you are told to say;
*	Do not try to send a signal or message; 
*	Follow orders such as sign a document or write a confession if not doing so threatens your wellbeing or that or others;
*	Provide details about your personal life if asked. These may offer proof of life during negotiations for your release. 

_Never get directly involved in the negotiations for your release. This will only complicate matters._
