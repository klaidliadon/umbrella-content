# Prevent kidnapping

The best defence against kidnapping is to have *and practise* a high-quality security management plan. 

Base security management on a thorough understanding of your location:

* General context and risks. 

* The specific threat of kidnapping, including:
	*	Past incidents;
    *	Presence of actors that carry out kidnapping;
    *	Promoting factors.

This understanding will help you reduce promoting factors and reduce opportunity.

## Who and why? 

### Kidnappers may be:

*   Criminals;
*   Political extremists;
*   Terrorists;
*   Militia groups;
*   Regimes that use terror.

### They may seek:

*   Ransom;
*   Political effect;
*   Publicity.

*Note: Kidnappers make demands. Abductors take people against their will. Hostage takers hold people under siege in a known location.*   

### Promoting factors may include:

*   The state's inability to provide protection and prosecute kidnappers;
*   Inadequate political, legal or military response encouraging more actors to become involved;
*   Media coverage of successful kidnap attempts;
*   High financial rewards from kidnapping.

## Prepare

If you operate in a high-risk location: 

*	Identify a reputable company specialising in hostage negotiations.

*	Connect with specialist advice in advance of a potential crisis.

*	Share completed [proof of life](umbrella://forms/f_proof-life-form.yml) forms with your team.

*	Train in serious incident management or kidnap negotiation.

*	Kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance is becoming more widespread.
