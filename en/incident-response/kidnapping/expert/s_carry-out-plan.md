## Mentally prepare

*	Manage team expectations;
*	Encourage optimism;  
*	Provide enough food and rest.

## Work effectively

The greatest aid to morale is to manage the incident well. 

*	Keep everyone fully informed;
*	Take the best available advice;
*	Record significant events and decisions;
*	Evaluate lessons learned where possible.

## Avoid paying ransom 

*	Paying ransom or making a concession may endanger more colleagues by encouraging further kidnaps;
*	Have a public policy of no ransom.
