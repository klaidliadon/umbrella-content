Other types of sexual assault can include unwanted touching or forced removal of clothing.   

## Sexual exploitation

Sexual exploitation such as the extortion of sexual favours for material and physical protection, is a form of enforced consent. 

## Sexual harassment

Sexual harassment can:

*	Suggestive remarks;
*	Close physical contact;
*	Suggestive looks;
*	Uninvited visits to your home or hotel room;
