A victim of sexual assault may need treatment for:

*	Injury;
* 	Involuntary pregnancy;
* 	Infectious disease. 

Treatment requires the victim's full understanding and agreement.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 

PEP is an emergency medical response to protect individuals exposed to HIV. It involves medication, laboratory tests and counselling.

Medication may still be beneficial if it is started *as soon as possible* after possible exposure to HIV and no later than 72 hours after, and continued for four weeks. It can cause side-effects and must be taken under medical supervision. (See World Health Organization 2013 guidelines ["Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV"](http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/arv2013/December2014-ARVsupplement-chap5.pdf).)

Medical tests for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV have to be repeated intermittently for up to a
year after the incident. 

### PEP kits

Some UN agencies and NGOs keep PEP starter kits in offices for the benefit
of staff and associated personnel. 

PEP kits contain: 

*	Medication for the first five days of PEP;
* 	A pregnancy test kit;
*  Emergency oral contraception (to be taken within 72 hours of intercourse);
*  Guidelines for the attending physician and the patient;
*  A consent form.

### Hepatitis B 

If the rape victim is not immune due to prior Hepatitis B infection, and has not
received a complete Hepatitis B vaccine series, then vaccination should be
offered. This is effective when started within 14 days of exposure. Additional
protection can be gained from Hepatitis B immunoglobuline.
