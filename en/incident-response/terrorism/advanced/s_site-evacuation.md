### You may need to plan or implement urgent evacuation of a site or building to evade imminent or potential threats.  

## Evacuation planning

* Who will need to evacuate? 
* Where to? How will they know where to go? 
* Should they take personal belongings or leave everything? How will they know? 
* Who will decide to evacuate the building or area? 
* How will they communicate the decision to everyone who needs to evacuate? 
* Who will communicate with emergency responders? 
* Will any other external communications be required, for example, with the media? 
* Who has limited mobility? How will they evacuate? 
* Who will supervise evacuation and check that everyone has assembled at the meeting point?  
* Who will stop other people entering the building? 
* Who will decide it is safe to return? 

## During evacuation

* Stay calm; 
* Visualise your next step;
* Follow the plan and any additional instructions;
* Avoid lifts, elevators, escalators;
* Assemble at a pre-arranged point.
