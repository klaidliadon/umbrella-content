title: Assess your risk

## Are direct attacks likely?

* Are criminal or terrorist groups active in your area? 
* Have criminals or terrorists attacked people like you?
* Have you or others like you received threats? 
* Could you be under surveillance?
* Could someone on the inside supply a terrorist group with information they could use to attack you?  
* Are there opportunities for adversaries to bring weapons to your workplace or events undiscovered?  

## Are indirect attacks likely? 

* Are you located near high profile targets? 
* Do you use busy transport systems? 
* Do government or law enforcement intelligence sources indicate a high risk of attack? 
* Do other sources of information indicate a high risk of attack?

## Warnings

* Recent and past attacks are not an adequate guide to future attacks. 
* Seek objective sources of information. Consider media coverage of attacks in a wider context of expert research and opinion.  
* It is natural to overestimate the threat of terrorist attacks, which are highly visible.

*Don't mitigate threats that are less likely to occur if it stops you from mitigating threats that are more likely to occur.*
