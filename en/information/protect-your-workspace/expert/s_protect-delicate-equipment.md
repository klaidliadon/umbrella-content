title: Protect delicate equipment
---
### Devices do not always adapt well to unstable electrical power, extreme temperatures, dust, moisture, mechanical stress and other hazards. 

This includes computers, networking equipment and data storage devices, CCTV cameras, printers, smart devices and other hardware. 

## Power fluctuations

Power surges, blackouts and brownouts can harm electronic components or destroy data on hard drives. 

- Plug all electronics into power strips that contain surge protectors. 

A surge protector should specify a maximum voltage and list a rating in joules. If your power supply is particularly unstable, you might also need a power filter or a line conditioner.

- If you can afford them, consider installing Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) and using those instead of regular surge protectors. 

A UPS will stabilise your power supply and provide temporary power in the event of a blackout. They are particularly valuable for local servers and desktop computers that lack internal batteries.

- Try to use electrical sockets and plugs that have ground lines. 

When moving into a new building, test the power supply before plugging in important equipment. If it behaves poorly with lights or fans, think twice before using it to power your computers.

## Environmental threats 

- Avoid placing important hardware in easily accessible locations like hallways and reception areas or next to windows. 

- Position surge protectors, UPSs, power strips and extension cables where they will not be unplugged or powered off by an accidental misstep.

- Invest in high-quality computer cables, surge protectors and power strips. Power strips that spark, fall out of wall sockets, fail to hold plugs securely or are fixed with duct tape can be quite dangerous.

- Ventilate cabinets that hold active computer equipment to prevent it from overheating. 

- Position computer equipment away from radiators, heating vents, air conditioners or other ductwork.
