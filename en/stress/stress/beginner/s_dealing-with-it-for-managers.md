title: Help others manage stress
---
### Teams need strong, stable, reliable leaders

*	Manage your own stress.
*	Help others manage stress. 

If you lead or manage a team, you may face stress due to:

*	A volatile environment;
*	Unrealistic expectations about how much you can do and how well you can do it;
*	Significant responsibility;
*	Work during weekends or holidays. 

But leaders who show symptoms of stress or burnout will demoralise the team and cause stress for others.

# Techniques

## Acknowledge your limitations. 

Admit that you are not immune to stress.

## Develop relationships with your own manager or support. 

Ask others to: 

*	Witness the challenges you face at first hand;
*	Protect you from impossible or unnecessary demands.

## Delegate. 

*	Choose team members with experience and ability;
*	Share tasks with your team;
*	Share responsibility even if you are the decision-maker. 

## Use a buddy system.

*	Find a sounding board outside your team. 
*	Agree to monitor other team members for symptoms of stress.

## Recognise others. 

People do better in difficult situations when they feel that other people care about them. 

*	Express appreciation on a regular basis. 
*	Be constructive when addressing problems.

## Encourage time off 

Overwork leads to burnout. 

*	Give others permission to take care of themselves. 
*	Rotate team members working in high-stress situations.

## Set an example. 

Demonstrate proper stress management by eating properly, resting and taking appropriate time off.
