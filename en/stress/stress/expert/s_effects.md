Symptoms vary for different people, but generally fall into these categories. 

You may:

*	Repeatedly relive your experience through involuntary and vivid flashbacks, nightmares, or images. 

*	Re-experience physical pain, sweating, trembling, or negative thoughts.

_Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD._

## Avoid reminders

*	Avoid people or places that remind you of the trauma.

*	Avoid talking to anyone about your experience. 

*	Distract yourself with work or hobbies. 

*	Try not to feel anything at all, becoming isolated and withdrawn.

## Feel on edge  

*	Feel very anxious and find it difficult to relax.

*   Substance abuse;  
*   Headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches;
