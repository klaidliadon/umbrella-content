- Psiphon is intended primarily as a censorship evasion tool, rather than one that guarantees anonymity.  
- Because Psiphon is VPN-based, it is able to proxy all of your Internet traffic, not just websites.   
- If you have not actively enabled Psiphon, you are not using the VPN. (Just having Psiphon on your computer is not enough.)  
- Web pages may load more slowly when using a VPN. This is normal, because the browser is not connecting directly to the website.  
- Some paid VPN services may be faster than free ones like Psiphon, but you should be careful before trusting a business with your information, as it could be shared with authorities or sold to other companies.
- Traffic between your device and the VPN server is encrypted. However, the traffic between that server and a non-HTTPS website will *not* be encrypted. (The same applies to other Internet services, such as when connecting with Outlook or Thunderbird to a non-SSL email provider.) 

### 2. Psiphon for Android

Download Psiphon Pro from the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psiphon3.subscription) store. 

If you don't have access to the Google Play store, select Psiphon Pro for Android on the official Psiphon [download page](https://psiphon.ca/en/download.html?10Years). (Verify the downloaded file is authentic [here](https://psiphon.ca/en/faq.html#authentic-android).)You may need to [enable sideloading](https://psiphon.ca/en/faq.html#android-enable-sideloading).)

Open the app and cLick *start* to connect to the Psiphon network.

Select Whole Device mode to tunnel all applications through Psiphon. (This option may not be available for older versions of Android. You can use the dedicated Psiphon browser instead, but only online activity conducted in the browser will use Psiphon. Other apps will connect using your regular Internet connection.)

The Psiphon "P" in the top left corner of your device indicates Psiphon is running.

### 3. Psiphon for Windows

Download the latest version of Psiphon for Windows [here](https://psiphon.ca/en/download.html). Verify that the downloaded file is authentic [here](https://psiphon.ca/en/faq.html#authentic-windows).)

When you run the program, you should see a security prompt showing that this program is a legitimate product of Psiphon Inc.

Psiphon automatically starts connecting when you run it. While it is connecting, a spinning icon is displayed. Connection to the Psiphon server is established when the green tick icon is displayed. 

When you close the program, Psiphon automatically disconnects. You can also click on the icon to toggle the connection.

### 4. Psiphon for iOS

A "VPN" icon in the top left corner of your device indicates Psiphon is running, meaning other apps will access the Internet through Psiphon.

To use the dedicated Psiphon browser for iOS requires a separate [download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/psiphon-browser/id1193362444?mt=8), but it works on iOS 8 or later, while the main Psiphon app requires iOS 10.2 or later. If you use the browser, only online activity conducted in the browser will use Psiphon. Other apps will connect using your regular Internet connection.
