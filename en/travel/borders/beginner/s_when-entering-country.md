# Arrivals or Departures

## Prepare for anything

Assume that:

*   You will be searched. 
*   Anything written will be read or copied.
*   Your equipment will be confiscated. 

_Note: Authorities may delay you or seize your devices if you refuse to give up a password or unlock your device._

(Learn more about this in [passwords expert](umbrella://information/passwords/expert).)

## Know your cover story

What you reveal to border authorities depends on context and risk. 

(Learn about risk assessment for travel [preparation](umbrella://travel/preparation).)

A cover story does not have to be the full truth, but it should be: 

*   Simple;
*   Easily repeatable;
*   Verifiable.

It may not be wise, or possible, to lie, but neither should you volunteer information. 

*   Provide minimal details.

*   Be prepared to be questioned about recent travel, visas or passport stamps.

*   Border authorities may require certain information, like where you will stay. Decide in advance how much to reveal.

*Note: Providing real information may increase your risk, but providing false information may be a red flag.* 

*	Set boundaries in advance. What sensitive information will you absolutely not reveal?

## Coordinate

*   Agree what you will say with your team and set boundaries in advance. 

*   Teams may attract attention. Travel and approach immigration separately. 

*Note: Authorities may already be aware that a big team is planning a visit or a meeting.*

*   Set a place to meet after immigration.

## Bring something else to do. 

*   Keep phone and Wi-Fi off, except in an emergency.  

*Note: Airport networks are notorious targets for surveillance and malware. Do not connect to airport Wi-Fi.*

*	In case of delay or emergency, set a time to turn on phones and check in. 

*	Working may attract attention, especially if you are travelling low profile.   

*   Do not discuss your trip, either with your team or on the phone. You may be overheard. 

## Remember:

*	Be polite, calm, confident, and firm with border authorities.

*	Do not get separated from your belongings, especially electronic items. If they are taken away, assume they are compromised.
