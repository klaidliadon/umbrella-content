Violence in a crowd situation can include: 

*	Harassment or assault;
*	Use of weapons, debris, petrol bombs, fire, pepper spray or tear gas. 

## Withdraw to a safe area

Crowds can turn very quickly. Trust your instinct.  

*	If you sense it is becoming unsafe or you are getting too much attention.

* If you encounter direct aggression or weapons.

* Avoid putting yourself in between protesters and authorities

* Monitor all side for changes in demeanor such as putting on balaclavas/respirators, throwing of stones or petrol bombs, the pointing of weapons

* Look for suitable escape routes from the position you are in and always make sure your pathway to them is clear. If it is not, re-position yourself.

*Reaching for items on the ground may be dangerous, or make you look like you are participating in violence.* 

## Protective clothing

*	Natural fibres are less likely to catch fire than synthetic fibres. 

*	Safety glasses, gas masks, or a wet towel over your nose and mouth can help protect your face from tear gas. Contact lenses and lotion may make the effects of tear gas worse. 

*   Protective vests and caps are available in riot kits.

*   It may make sense to have specific clothing that identifies you as a member of the media or monitoring group

*Avoid masks or equipment that make you look like police.*
